A little hobby, nothing big, feel free to poke around!

devmode, a variable in the main.js file will allow you access to the developer/tester features. Turn it off for a more raw, player-oriented experience. Pointing out bugs is always appreciated!

This is supposed to be a text-gui based adventure in which the player navigated through richly designed maps & levels further enriched by interesting NPC and maybe weird combat (probably not)
This game was inspired by: Enter The Gungeon, Paper Mario 64, Terraria, and my own life experiences
